A decentralized, trust based system for communication and trade
11.21.11

Goals:
Share your content with a limited audience
Stamp a seal to assert authorship
Ask questions
Share ratings and other metadata about other ppls content

Use case: Freetube
As someone who wants to publish content to everyone
I need absolute control over my content
So I can't get my channel shut down or censored
And so I can keep all of the ad money

Use case: Private Interaction
As someone who wants to communicate with some parties, without anyone/everyone listening
I need to publish text, voice, photo, video to a specific, limited audience
And inform them of the information hygiene policy associated with the content
So we can be private

Use case: Science
As a scientist who wants to learn and share truth
I need somewhere to publish my findings to all interested parties
So other scientists can validate or invalidate the truth of the findings
I also need funding
