A decentralized, trust based system for communication and trade

General Goals:
===
Share content to your audience alone
Include metadata describing content rules like sharing/remixing
Stamp a seal to assert and prove your authorship
Explore programmatic rules and rulescapes
Be a global community

Use cases
===

Freetube
---
As someone who sometimes publishes objectionable content
I need to own my content
And distribute it as I like
So I can't get my channel shut down or censored
And so I can keep all of the ad money

Private Interaction
---
As someone who wants to communicate with some parties, without everyone/anyone listening
I need to publish content to a specific, limited audience
So we can be private

As someone with a newbie counterparty
I need to inform them of the information hygiene policy associated with the content
And the system should enforce the policy by default
So the counterparty \<retains it, doesn't share it, burns it after reading... \>

Science
---
As a scientist who wants to learn and share truth
I need somewhere to publish my findings to all interested parties
So other scientists can validate or invalidate the truth of the findings

As a scientist investigating unpopular truths
I need community funding
So I can contribute to the search for truth without big money

As a science funder
I need to find scientists who the community trusts
So I don't waste my money

Distributed Governance
---
As Bitcoin stakeholders
We need a forum where we can approach consensus
And where we have tools to optimize information exchange
So we can discover a governance rulescape that is a Pareto optimal among stakeholders

As a user of a distributed forum
I need to filter information according to my personal trust decisions
So I can ignore content I perceive as having negative value
Such as messages from users I believe to be shills, scammers, spammers

As one guy
I need to delegate decisions about evaluating content value to those I trust
Because I can't identify all the scammers by myself


Trade
---
As someone with information, goods or services to sell
I need somewhere to publish and discover orders
And ruleset governing trust
So that I can find counterparties who won't fuck me

Mashups
---
As someone who wants to put my advertising slogan on someone else's picture
Or add a rap track to someone else's beat 
I want to attribute all content authors
So people who find the mashup can find the authors

As a mashup consumer
I want the mashup to include the child content by reference
So that I don't waste bandwidth re-downloading if I already have some of the child content
