A decentralized, trust based system for human interaction
11.21.11

### Shortterm Goals
Organize human and corporate contacts across many networks
 - I want the software to keep track of my friend's aliases for me
 - e.g. wechat/vk/reddit/xbox/psn/steam/fb/insta/google/twitter...
Map useful info about contacts and projects
 - their content, what problem domains they solve, related contacts

### Midterm Goals
Create local trust scores for contacts
Use networks' API's to:
- simul-post content to many networks
- collate and filter feeds from many networks
  - recent activity by <contact>

### Longterm Goals:
Collaboratively create combined trust scores
Share content to your audience alone
Include metadata describing content rules like sharing/remixing
Stamp a seal to assert and prove your authorship
Explore programmatic rules and rulescapes (One day I want to resolve a digital dispute by competing in a mutually agreeable video game match)
Be a global community

### Use cases (unless already accomplished?)

#### Freetube
As someone who sometimes publishes objectionable content
I need to own my content
And distribute it as I like
So I can't get my channel shut down or censored
And so I can keep all of the ad money
(accomplished by **alexandria.io**: [overview](http://www.alexandria.io/learn/#learn1), [content](https://alexandria.io/browser/media))

#### Private Interaction
As someone who wants to communicate with some parties, without everyone/anyone listening
I need to publish content to a specific, limited audience
So we can be private
(accomplished by [**Signal**](https://www.whispersystems.org/))

As someone with a newbie counterparty
I need to inform them of the information hygiene policy associated with the content
And the system should enforce the policy by default
So the counterparty \<retains it, doesn't share it, burns it after reading... \>

#### Science
As a scientist who wants to learn and share truth
I need somewhere to publish my findings to all interested parties
So other scientists can validate or invalidate the truth of the findings

As a scientist investigating unpopular truths
I need community funding
So I can contribute to the search for truth without big money

As a science funder
I need to find scientists who the community trusts
So I don't waste my money

#### Distributed Governance
As Bitcoin stakeholders
We need a forum where we can approach consensus
And where we have tools to optimize information exchange
So we can discover a governance rulescape that is a Pareto optimal among stakeholders

As a user of a distributed forum
I need to filter information according to my personal trust decisions
So I can ignore content I perceive as having negative value
Such as messages from users I believe to be shills, scammers, spammers

As one guy
I need to delegate decisions about evaluating content value to those I trust
Because I can't identify all the scammers by myself


#### Trade
As someone with information, goods or services to sell
I need somewhere to publish, discover and execute orders
So I can make money

(accomplished by [**openbazaar**](https://www.openbazaar.org/))

As someone with information, goods or services to sell
And ruleset governing trust
So that I can find counterparties who won't fuck me

#### Mashups
As someone who wants to put my advertising slogan on someone else's picture
Or add a rap track to someone else's beat
I want to attribute all content authors
So people who find the mashup can find the authors

As a mashup consumer
I want the mashup to include the child content by reference
So that I don't waste bandwidth re-downloading if I already have some of the child content
